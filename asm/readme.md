Put ASM code into https://costycnc.github.io/avr-compiler-js/
.

This is an online AVR ASM bare-metal compiler and uploader based on WebSerial, made by myself.

Just write your ASM code, compile it, and upload directly to an Arduino Nano, Uno, etc. (you only need a USB cable and an Arduino).

No IDE, no libraries, nothing else required.

Perfect for beginners with no programming knowledge!
