# costycnc-rc-car-arduino-ide

This project allows you to control a toy RC car using an Arduino by sending serial commands.
The car responds with precise movements based on microsecond-level pulse signals (W1/W2).

It‚Äôs ideal for learning Arduino programming, microcontroller signal timing, and basic RC car electronics.

üß∞ Hardware Components

Arduino Uno or compatible

Toy RC car chassis

Jumper wires for signal, power, and ground

Power source (battery or USB)

‚öôÔ∏è Wiring / Connections

Connect Arduino D2 pin to the RC car signal input (as in rc_car1.jpg).

Connect ground and power lines from Arduino to the car.

Ensure the connections are solid to avoid signal issues.

üíª Software
üì• Uploading Code

Open rc_car1.ino in the Arduino IDE.

Select the correct board and COM port.

Upload the code to the Arduino.

üîß Supported Commands (via Serial Monitor)
Command	Movement
a	Forward
b	Forward Turbo
c	Forward & Left
d	Forward & Right
e	Backward
f	Backward & Right
g	Backward & Left
h	Left
i	Right
‚ö° Pulse Signal Logic

W2 signal (1.5ms high, 0.5ms low)

digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(1500);
digitalWrite(2, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(500);


W1 signal (0.5ms high, 0.5ms low)

digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(500);
digitalWrite(2, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(500);


These signals encode movement commands to the car‚Äôs motor controller.

CostyCNC Toy RC Car ‚Äì Arduino IDE

Control a toy RC car using Arduino via serial commands

This project enables controlling a toy RC car directly via Arduino using serial commands and precise microsecond pulse signals. It‚Äôs perfect for learning Arduino programming, microcontroller signal timing, and basic RC car electronics.

üß∞ Hardware Components

Arduino Uno or compatible

Toy RC car chassis

Jumper wires for signal, power, and ground

Power source (battery or USB)

‚öôÔ∏è Wiring / Connections

Connect Arduino Pin 2 (D2) to the RC car signal input.

Connect ground and power lines from Arduino to the car.

Ensure solid connections to prevent signal errors.

See rc_car1.jpg in the repository for a visual wiring guide.

üíª Software
üì• Uploading the Code

Open rc_car1.ino in Arduino IDE.

Select the correct board (Arduino Uno) and COM port.

Upload the code to the Arduino board.

üîß Supported Commands (via Serial Monitor)
Command	Action
a	Forward
b	Forward Turbo
c	Forward & Left
d	Forward & Right
e	Backward
f	Backward & Right
g	Backward & Left
h	Left
i	Right

Commands are sent directly via Arduino Serial Monitor.

‚ö° Pulse Signal Logic

The car is controlled using precise pulse signals:

W2 signal (1.5ms HIGH, 0.5ms LOW)

digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(1500);
digitalWrite(2, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(500);


W1 signal (0.5ms HIGH, 0.5ms LOW)

digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(500);
digitalWrite(2, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(500);


These signals encode movement commands to the car‚Äôs motor controller.
